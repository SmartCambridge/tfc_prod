# Make sure we are receiving SIRI-VM data
#
# While most of the time data should be be recieved several time a
# minute, there are occasional pauses overnight which aren't worth
# reporting. To address this we run one monitor with a long timeout
# and a second one with a shorter timeout that is turned off by cron
# overnight.
